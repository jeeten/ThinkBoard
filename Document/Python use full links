Python - Agenda
--------------------
Introduction - histry - features - pro & cons
setup - setting up envirnment - installaing for different os - ides and tools
Language Basics - varialble , looping, Operator
Data Stractures - list, tupples, set
Functions - 
Modules - groupin function is called a module
Exception Handling
Packages - grouping multiple modules together
File Handling - read - write
Oop Concepts - polymorphysm - method overloading,opertor overloading, over riding, inheritance
Standard Library - python is a very rich collection of modules and librarys - multithreding - unit testing
Regular Expression - 
DB Handling - database handeling

Features of Python
--------------------
1. It is a language for beginners, its very fun to pick,
2. it is a language which is easy to read/write/maintain - minimal number of keywords - stracture is very simple - less coding
3. Intractive interpreter ( No Compilation or linking ) - python process our code in runtime - its not going to store in memory - REPL (Read - Eavalute - Print - Loop)
4. Object oriented from day one - python supports procedural programing and object programing
5 Portable - its availabe for all the os - windows - linux -Mac os
6 Open source
7 Built in Type/Tools/Library
8 Rich Collection for third party library
9 Automatic Memory Management - Memory will deloacted once object is no more in use
10 Anything in python is an object
11 Python doesnot support any data types
12 Strongly typed language
13 Dynamically typed language - no variable declaration needed - varaibles stateway can be assigend a value


The python Source code (.py) is converted into intermidiate code called byte code with extantion (.tyc) which is plat form independent and later on securely excuted by PVM	
Python interpreters - 
cpython - the standard Python interpreter written in c89 - embedding c programs in python and vice versa
Jython - embedding java programs in python and vice versa
IronPython - embedding .Net programs in python and vice versa
PyPy - the python interpreter writen in python itself


Devloped in back 1990

python is good for automation and its very good with selenium

Running Python Script
---------------------

By python intractive console >>>
command lile python file.py
use IDEs like idle, eclips ( with pyDev plugin, you can convert eclips into python IDEs ) and PyCharm

Language Basics
----------------


Reverse Keywards
-------------------

comment in python
---------------------
# pound dymbol is used for single line comment
'''---------''' tripple quote is act like as multiple line comment b	ut main purpose is docstrings

opertores
-----------
/ 
//

Data type convers function
--------------------------
int(), float()
----------------------------
dir(__builtins__) - to get all the content
type() - to know the type of the content
help() - manual of the given parameter
math - you have to import math first and use the function of its by math.function name
end
locals() # to know the defined variables

# os - any dos command will work using this modul
os.system('cls')
isinstance("name",str) # to check weather it is an instace of the given data type
list('apple');

Different Data types - Collection of data stracture
-------------------------------------------
List - its an index array unlimited size, it is a hactrogeneous type of value - it can represent by [] square bracket
	Example : [1,98,10,6,'amit','1.0'], 
	[lowe limit: uper limit], 
	[:] = [] #empty initialisation
	len() # to know the size
	del listName # to delete the list
        a=a+[1,2] #not recomanded
	a.append(2) 
	a.append([1,2,4]) #
	a.extend([1,2,4]) #
	a.insert(index:0,value:1000)
	list is mutable means can modify
        a.count(2)# count the presence of the passed value
        a.remove(2) # remove by value
	del a[1] #remove by position
	a.pop() #remove the last elemet in default byt you can remove by pass a possition
	max(),min() # it will work on in integer list only
        sum() # it will work on in integer list only
        help(list) # will give all the methods of the list
	list(range(5))
	a.reverse() # 
	value in list # to check the value is exist or not
        zip #
	

Tuple - Read only List - it can represent by () bracket, its are very fast as compare to list
	reveresed(), sorted()

Set - Unique collection of list, elements will enclosed by {}
	a.add(12)
	
Dictionary - Assoucitve array key/value - very quick to acess
	d = {'Name':'Raju'}
	d.clear() # will delete the all key
	del d# delete the dictionary
	d.keys()
	d.values()
	d.items()

controll stractures
